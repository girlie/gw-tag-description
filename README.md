*Thesis Box to Display Tag Description*
A handy way to add the description to your tag pages.

* Upload the `.zip` file via Thesis → Boxes → Manage Boxes → Upload Box.
* Once the box has been uploaded and appears in the list of available boxes, select its checkbox and then click SAVE BOXES.
* Go to Skin Editor → HTML, and access the Archive → Tag template for editing.
* Using `shift+drag`, add the Tag Description box to the template (the Archive Intro container box is a good location for it).
* Save the template.
